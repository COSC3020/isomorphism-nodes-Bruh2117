# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ do not have the same number of nodes, they
cannot be isomorphic. I have started with the formal definition of isomorphism
below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

# Theorem: 

If A and B don't have the same number of nodes, they cannot be isomorphic, which is the same as saying the contrapositive

If A and B are isomorphic, then A and be have the same number of nodes

# Proof: 

Suppose A and B are isomorphic, meaning for $A = (V_1 , E_1)$ and $B = (V_2 , E_2) $, there exists a bijective function $f: V_1 -> V_2$ such that $(u, v) \in E_1$ iff $(f(u), f(v)) \in E_2$. 

Also suppose A and B to have a finite number of elements. 

For there to be a bijective function between A and B, by the definition of bijection, they must have the same cardinality, or rather the same number of nodes in this case, thus proving the theorem.
